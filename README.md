The R package **splines2** (version 0.4.0.9000) provides functions to
construct basis matrix of

-   B-splines
-   M-splines
-   I-splines
-   convex splines (C-splines)
-   periodic M-splines
-   generalized Bernstein polynomials
-   nonnegative natural cubic splines
-   their integrals (except C-splines) and derivatives of given order by
    close-form recursive formulas

In addition to the R interface, **splines2** also provides a C++
header-only library integrated with **Rcpp**, which allows construction
of spline basis matrix directly in C++ with the help of **Rcpp** and
**RcppArmadillo**. So it can also be treated as one of the **Rcpp\***
packages. A toy example package that uses the C++ interface is available
[here](https://github.com/wenjie2wang/example-pkg-Rcpp-splines2).

## Installation of CRAN Version

You can install the released version from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=splines2).

``` r
install.packages("splines2")
```

## Development

The latest version of package is under development at
[GitHub](https://github.com/wenjie2wang/splines2). If it is able to pass
the automated package checks, one may install it by

``` r
if (! require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wenjie2wang/splines2", upgrade = "never")
```

## Getting Started

[Online document](https://wwenjie.org/splines2) provides reference for
all functions and contains the following vignettes:

-   [Demonstration of the common usages in R through
    examples](https://wwenjie.org/splines2/articles/splines2-intro).
-   [Introduction to the usage with
    Rcpp](https://wwenjie.org/splines2/articles/splines2-wi-rcpp)

## Performance

Since v0.3.0, the implementation of the main functions has been
rewritten in C++ with the help of the **Rcpp** and **RcppArmadillo**
package. The computational performance has thus been boosted.

Some benchmarks are provided for reference as follows:

``` r
library(microbenchmark)
library(splines); packageVersion("splines")
```

    [1] '4.0.3'

``` r
library(splines2); packageVersion("splines2")
```

    [1] '0.4.0.9000'

``` r
x <- seq.int(0, 1, 0.001)
degree <- 3
ord <- degree + 1
knots <- seq.int(0.1, 0.9, 0.1)
b_knots <- range(x)
all_knots <- sort(c(knots, rep(b_knots, ord)))

## check equivalency of outputs
my_check <- function(values) {
    all(sapply(values[- 1], function(x) {
        all.equal(unclass(values[[1]]), x, check.attributes = FALSE)
    }))
}
```

For B-splines, function `splines2::bSpline()` provides equivalent
results with `splines::bs()` and `splines::splineDesign()`, and is about
3x faster than `bs()` and 2x faster than `splineDesign()`.

``` r
## B-splines
microbenchmark(
    "splines::bs" = bs(x, knots = knots, degree = degree,
                       intercept = TRUE, Boundary.knots = b_knots),
    "splines::splineDesign" = splineDesign(x, knots = all_knots, ord = ord),
    "splines2::bSpline" = bSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = degree,
                                  intercept = TRUE, Boundary.knots = b_knots),
    check = my_check,
    times = 1e3
)
```

    Unit: microseconds
                      expr     min      lq   mean  median     uq    max neval cld
               splines::bs 333.749 348.617 388.90 358.440 377.56 2498.6  1000   c
     splines::splineDesign 203.887 208.859 237.79 213.392 225.03 2368.5  1000  b 
         splines2::bSpline  84.793  91.834 112.42  95.251 101.62 2223.7  1000 a  

Similarly, for derivatives of B-splines, `splines2::dbs()` provides
equivalent results with `splines::splineDesign()`, and is more than 2x
faster.

``` r
## Derivatives of B-splines
derivs <- 2
microbenchmark(
    "splines::splineDesign" = splineDesign(x, knots = all_knots,
                                           ord = ord, derivs = derivs),
    "splines2::dbs" = dbs(x, derivs = derivs, knots = knots, degree = degree,
                          intercept = TRUE, Boundary.knots = b_knots),
    check = my_check,
    times = 1e3
)
```

    Unit: microseconds
                      expr     min      lq   mean median     uq    max neval cld
     splines::splineDesign 274.122 280.075 321.67 287.29 303.82 4302.5  1000   b
             splines2::dbs  94.824  99.975 123.74 103.18 110.19 2436.1  1000  a 

The **splines** package does not provide function producing integrals of
B-splines. So we instead performed a comparison with package **ibs**
(version 1.4), where the function `ibs::ibs()` was also implemented in
**Rcpp**.

``` r
## integrals of B-splines
set.seed(123)
coef_sp <- rnorm(length(all_knots) - ord)
microbenchmark(
    "ibs::ibs" = ibs::ibs(x, knots = all_knots, ord = ord, coef = coef_sp),
    "splines2::ibs" = as.numeric(
        splines2::ibs(x, knots = knots, degree = degree,
                      intercept = TRUE, Boundary.knots = b_knots) %*% coef_sp
    ),
    check = my_check,
    times = 1e3
)
```

    Unit: microseconds
              expr     min      lq    mean  median      uq      max neval cld
          ibs::ibs 2384.52 2682.02 3250.42 3146.05 3365.27 113546.3  1000   b
     splines2::ibs  264.84  326.24  433.53  349.99  361.85   7268.1  1000  a 

The function `ibs::ibs()` returns the integrated B-splines instead of
the integrals of spline bases. So we applied the same coefficients to
the bases from `splines2::ibs()` for equivalent results, which was still
much faster than `ibs::ibs()`.

For natural cubic splines (based on B-splines), `splines::ns()` uses QR
decomposition to find the null space of the second derivatives of
B-spline basis at boundary knots, while `splines2::naturalSpline()`
utilizes the close-form null space that can be derived from the
recursive formulas of B-splines, which produces nonnegative bases
(within boundary) and is more computationally efficient.

``` r
microbenchmark(
    "splines::ns" = ns(x, knots = knots, intercept = TRUE,
                       Boundary.knots = b_knots),
    "splines2::naturalSpline" = naturalSpline(
        x, knots = knots, intercept = TRUE, Boundary.knots = b_knots
    ),
    times = 1e3
)
```

    Unit: microseconds
                        expr    min     lq   mean median     uq    max neval cld
                 splines::ns 617.65 641.41 725.34 656.38 681.46 3543.4  1000   b
     splines2::naturalSpline 130.01 139.77 167.25 149.88 156.82 2760.1  1000  a 

The function `mSpline()` produces periodic spline basis (based on
M-splines) when `periodic = TRUE` is specified. The
`splines::periodicSpline()` returns a periodic interpolation spline
(based on B-splines) instead of basis matrix. So we performed a
comparison with package **pbs** (version 1.1), where the function
`pbs::pbs()` produces a basis matrix of periodic B-spline by using
`splines::spline.des()` (a wrapper function of
`splines::splineDesign()`).

``` r
microbenchmark(
    "pbs::pbs" = pbs::pbs(x, knots = knots, degree = degree, intercept = TRUE,
                          Boundary.knots = b_knots, periodic = TRUE),
    "splines2::naturalSpline" = mSpline(
        x, knots = knots, degree = degree, intercept = TRUE,
        Boundary.knots = b_knots, periodic = TRUE
    ),
    times = 1e3
)
```

    Unit: microseconds
                        expr    min     lq   mean median     uq    max neval cld
                    pbs::pbs 427.04 440.99 501.47 452.21 469.57 3805.5  1000   b
     splines2::naturalSpline 121.99 130.05 154.12 139.06 144.34 3019.3  1000  a
